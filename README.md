![Documentation](https://github.com/dehlen/Log/workflows/Documentation/badge.svg)

A fast & simple, yet powerful & flexible logging framework for Mac and iOS.

## Installation

Currently only Swift Package Manager is supported. 
Swift Package Manager is a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency... and enter package repository URL https://github.com/dehlen/Log.git, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open Swift Packages (which is next to Build Settings). You can add and remove packages from this tab.

## Documentation
The documentation is automatically generated thanks to [swift-doc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc). When a push on master happens a GitHub Action runs to generate the documentation and to deploy it to GitHub Pages.
You can find the latest version here: https://dehlen.github.io/Log
